1. Change the directive from an ELEMENT to an ATTRIBUTE. Modify the HTML accordingly. (HINT: LOOK AT THE RESTRICT)

2. Bind an addition controller scope variable to the directive scope. Use the scope object in the directive to bind to the new variable (HINT: REMEMBER THIS HAS TO BE PASSED AS AN ATTRIBUTE!)

3. Modify the link function to include another directive scope function that outputs the value of your new SCOPE variable.
