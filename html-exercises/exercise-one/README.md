Exercise One
=============

This exercise is to help build your understanding and comfort with CSS. For this exercise you won't need to modify the HTML at all. You only need to fill out style.css to make the webpage look similar to the image below. It doesn't need to be perfect, only recognizable. Feel free to add some of your own flair to the design!
