January 27th Homework Problems
================================

For each problem, create a javascript file that matches the problem name. For 
example one.js would be for problem one, two.js would be for problem two, and
so forth. All files should be executable using node command-line tool in terminal
(`node ***.js`).

<h2>One</h2>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we 
get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Write a JavaScript program that prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5
below 1000.

<h2>Two</h2>
Write a JavaScript program that prints the current time in the format of HH:MM
(hours:minutes)

<h3>Three</h3>
Demonstrate nested functions (a function inside of another function) and how 
to run the inner function (without running the entire outer function).

<h4>Four</h4>
Write a javascript program that has a variable called `num`. Using for-loops,
create the following pattern:

```javascript
xxxxxxxxxx
x        x
x        x
x        x
x        x
x        x
x        x
x        x
x        x
xxxxxxxxxx
```

based on the value of `num`. With the previous pattern, `num` would be 10.
