## Two-way Data Bindings
#### (The reason everyone uses angular)

For this exercise, simply bind the `input` tag (using `ng-model`) to the `p` tag so that Johnny English's car will greet whomever types their name into the box.

*Hint: don't forget to load in AngularJS from the [cdn](https://angularjs.org/)*

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Johnny English's Car</title>
	</head>
	
	<body>
		What is your name? <input type="text"> <!-- input name here -->
		<p>
			<img src="https://thecarspy.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/rrpc.jpg?w=614&h=296"/>
		</p>
		<p>How do you do<!-- insert name here -->?</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

If you get stuck, check out the [basic example](https://angularjs.org/#the-basics) on the AngularJS home page.

. . . and don't stop here. Keep messing with this code to do something really cool with it.
