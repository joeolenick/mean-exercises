Weekend Exercise 4 -- Shopping Cart
===================================

The AngularJS project for this class will be to build a shopping cart app, so this weekend project is to write the HTML/CSS for the shopping cart.

The shopping cart will have 4 different views:
- Cart View
- Payment Info
- Review Order
- Order Complete

This means you will need 4 different HTML files (one for each view).

It's important that you write your HTML code legibly (by using unequivocal class names and good indentation, etc.) because when you wire it up with angular, you will need to go back through and add all the data-bindings and directives.

Here are the screenshots of what your shopping cart should look like. You are welcome to design your cart in whatever way you like, as long as it has all the required elements.
